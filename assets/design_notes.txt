Design Notes- 

Whats working:
1) The images are draggable and can be dropped into the zone.
2) Audio file is place 

Whats not woeking:
1) Used the same images we did in class. Whenever we change it, it breaks.
Solution:
We guess it mainly have to do with the draggable id. If we get to know how to get the id for the image, we would be able to find a solution

2) The audio file is place but not playing
Solution:
Not idea why.
